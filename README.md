## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Iâ€™m currently learning ...Web Development via Udemy. I have already obtained my certificate in UX/UI design, but I continue to learn because I don't want to
 be average, I want to be good in the industry. That said. This file is the coded resume I did through the course using only HTML.
